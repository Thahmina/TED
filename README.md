The TED toolkit is a comprehensive approach to processing and analyzing RNA-seq data. TED is divided into three major modules: data quality control, transcriptome data analysis, and data discovery, with ten pipelines in total. 

TED is implemented on an instance of the Galaxy platform: http://galaxy.hunter.cuny.edu/ and the pipelines can be found at the following page: http://galaxy.hunter.cuny.edu/workflows/list_published. 

The TED pipelines can be access and run on our Galaxy platform (email to request account). For users who would like their own instance of Galaxy can set up using the following documentation: https://galaxyproject.org/admin/get-galaxy/ and import the TED pipelines onto their instance or any other Galaxy instance: https://galaxyproject.org/toolshed/workflow-sharing/ 

The TED pipelines consist of modified tools made available in this github repository that will need to be implemented into the Galaxy instance in which the user will use the TED pipelines. The TED tools are published in the main toolshed and can be installed via administrator privileges: https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/bioitcore/transcriptomics_easy_for_discovery_toolkit/2061c255db14
